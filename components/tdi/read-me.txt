  A Tabbed GUI Interface 

  Lazarus does not have full support for MDI interface yet, and commercial
applications need to open several windows at once without ShowModal.

  However, the MDI interface concept has several problems, which may confuse the
novice user. A more complete study on the advantages and disadvantages of the
MDI can be found at wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_document_interface#
Comparison_with_single_document_interface

  The intention of this component is to provide a simple way to create an TDI
interface, similar to that described in Wikipedia.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabbed_document_interface

  I used TExtendedNotebook as a base component, introducing new methods and
properties to provide support for TDI. Very few changes will be needed in your
code, and component TTDINotebook will handle the entire process of creation and
destruction of the tabs and menus automatically.

=== 10 - Methods and Properties ===

* procedure ShowFormInPage( AForm: TForm; ImageIndex : Integer = -1 );
  Show a already created Form in a new Page. If there is an Page that already
  owns this Form variable, it will bring it to front, rather than create a new
  Page.

  Create a New AFormClass, in a new Page.
  ( Remember to assign CloseAction := caFree; on OnClose event of this Form)

  This will fire OnCloseQuery of the Internal Form reference to a APageIndex Tab,
  and Returns True if it can be Closed.

* Function FindFormInPages( AForm: TForm): Integer ;
  Search an Page that owns AForm variable, returning the TabIndex if found or -1
  if doesn't.
